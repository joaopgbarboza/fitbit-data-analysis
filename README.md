Summary

In this analysis we've have found through the data that as more active they are, more calories they burn. Also the most active days of the week are Saturday and Tuesday, and interestingly the days that people sleep more are Sunday and Wednesday. In addition there is a positive correlation between time spent in bed and minutes of sleep. Last but not least, an important data is that **16% of the people are Sedentary** (based on our ranking counting total steps).
